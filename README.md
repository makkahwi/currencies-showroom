# Currencies Showroom

Welcome to my "Currencies Showroom", a Vue.Js-Django Based Open-source Project

This is originally a coding project to learn the frontend tech used (Vue.Js), but it was decided to kill two birds with one stone. So beside mastering the tech, it's also to build an actual & usable web app to serve "money collection" hobbyists.

It's a web app to publish one's collection of currencies from all over the world to all over the world. Where collectors would clone this project & deploy it to enlist their currencies, and the public could just browse their showrooms right away.

## Features

When it's ready for a release, features will be listed here.

## How to deploy & start using as a collector

For auto deploying purposes, app was split into two seperated github repos. You may visit each of them to follow progress.

[Frontend](https://github.com/makkahwi/currencies-showroom-client)

[Backend](https://github.com/makkahwi/currencies-showroom-server)

Instructions are to be shaped when the app is readly for a release

## Stay tuned üïê
